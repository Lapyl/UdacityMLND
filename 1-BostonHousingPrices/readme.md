###OBJECTIVE:

This is an assignment for Project 1 (Predicting Boston Housing Prices) of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

###PROBLEM:

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

###DATA:

The necessary dataset is explained at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing
and is available through the scikit-learn datasets package.

###METHOD:

A starting Python code (boston_housing) was given by Udacity. The code was improved and finalized.

###CONCUSIONS:

Answers to the questions were prepared after running the code, in a separate document.
