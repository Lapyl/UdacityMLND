###OBJECTIVE:

This is an assignment for Project 2 (Build a Student Intervention System) of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

###PROBLEM:

As education has grown to rely more and more on technology, more and more data is available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities, grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more are now available in real time. Educators are after new ways to predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions, as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions. Toward that end, your goal is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam.

###DATA:

The necessary dataset was provided as student-data.csv file and was explained in its readme file.

###METHOD:

A starting iPython notebook code (student_intervention.ipynb) was given by Udacity. The code was improved and finalized.

###CONCUSIONS:

Answers to the questions were prepared after running the code, in a separate document.
