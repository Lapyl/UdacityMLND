###OBJECTIVE:

This is an assignment for Project 3 (Creating Customer Segments) of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

###PROBLEM:

Most of the data one collects doesn’t necessarily fit into nice, labeled categories. Many times not only is data not labeled, but categories are unknown! In this project we will take unstructured data, and then attempt to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. First you’ll learn about methods that are useful for dealing with data without labels, then you’ll apply this to a dataset of your choice, learning what natural categories sit inside it.

###DATA:

The necessary dataset was provided as wholesale-customers.csv file and was explained in its readme file.

###METHOD:

A starting iPython notebook code (customer_segments.ipynb) was given by Udacity. The code was improved and finalized.

###CONCUSIONS:

Answers to the questions were prepared based on the code outputs, within the iPython notebook.
